Implementation Plan and Tech Stack Details
======================================

This document explains how this AI Health Chatbot is built and what tools are used, in simple and easy-to-understand language.

1. Implementation Plan (Step-by-Step)
-------------------------------------

We built this app in stages, like building a house. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Setting Up the Foundation
- We started by creating a main folder for our project.
- We installed "Node.js", which is the engine that runs our server (the brain of the app).
- We also installed specific tools (libraries) we need, like "Express" (to handle web requests) and "Twilio" (to send messages).

Step 2: Creating the Memory (Database)
- We set up a simple database using "SQLite". Think of this as a digital notebook.
- We created pages in this notebook (tables) to save:
  - User details (Name, Age, Language).
  - Health questions asked by users.
  - Emergency alerts (when someone is very sick).

Step 3: Building the Server (The Brain)
- We wrote a file called `server.js`. This is where the app actually runs.
- The server listens for messages coming from WhatsApp or SMS.
- It acts like a receptionist: when a message comes in, it decides where to send it.

Step 4: Making the Chatbot Smart (Bot Logic)
- We created `bot.js`. This is the script that decides what to say back to you.
- It uses a "Flow" system. For example:
  - First, it asks for your language.
  - Then, it asks for your name and age.
  - Finally, it shows you a menu (Ask Question, Get Tips, etc.).
- It remembers where you are in the conversation so it doesn't get confused.

Step 5: Adding Artificial Intelligence (The Brain Upgrade)
- We connected our bot to "Google Gemini". This is a super-smart AI.
- When you ask a health question (like "I have a headache"), the bot sends it to Gemini.
- Gemini writes a helpful answer, and the bot sends it back to you on WhatsApp.

Step 6: Building the Dashboard (The Control Center)
- We made a website for doctors or admins to see what is happening.
- We used a tool called "React" to build this.
- The dashboard shows charts/graphs of how many people are using the bot and a list of all registered users.

Step 7: Connecting to the Outside World
- Since our server runs on a personal computer, the outside world (like WhatsApp) can't see it.
- We used a tool called "Ngrok" or "Localtunnel" to create a secure tunnel. This lets WhatsApp send messages to our computer safely.

2. Tech Stack (Tools Used) - In Detail
------------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a list of the specific technologies we used and why we chose them.

A. Backend (The Engine Room)
   - **Node.js**: The software that lets us run JavaScript code on a computer/server. It's fast and handles many messages at once.
   - **Express.js**: A framework that makes using Node.js easier. It helps us organize our code into "routes" (paths) for different tasks.
   - **SQLite**: A lightweight database. It stores data in a single file on your computer, so it's very easy to set up and doesn't need a big, complex server.

B. AI & Intelligence
   - **Google Gemini (Generative AI)**: This is the AI model we use. It understands human language and can answer complex health questions intelligently.

C. Communication (Messaging)
   - **Twilio**: A service that lets our code send and receive SMS and WhatsApp messages. It acts as the bridge between our code and your phone.

D. Frontend / Dashboard (The Visual Part)
   - **React.js**: A popular tool for building websites. It allows us to make the dashboard interactive (buttons click, pages change instantly).
   - **Vite**: A tool that helps us build and run the React website very quickly.
   - **Material UI (@mui/material)**: A collection of pre-designed buttons, boxes, and layouts. It makes our dashboard look professional and beautiful without us having to design every single pixel.
   - **Recharts**: A library used to draw the colorful graphs and charts on the dashboard.

E. Tools for Connectivity
   - **Ngrok / Localtunnel**: These are "Tunneling Services". They give our local computer a temporary web address (public URL) so services like Twilio can reach us while we are developing.
